**Full-Stack Engineer Take-Home Challenge: Authentication Page**

**Objective:** Create a login and signup page for a green energy platform that demonstrates your skills in full-stack development, including UI design, backend integration, and security best practices. Feel free to make key design and implementation decisions according to your best practice knowledge to showcase your abilities.

**Requirements:**

**Frontend:**

- Develop a responsive login/signup page using a front-end framework, preferably Angular (but React or Vue are also acceptable).
- The page should include:
  - A signup form where users can register using their name, email, and password.
  - A login form for users to authenticate with email and password.
  - Validations to ensure data quality and a smooth user experience.
- Design a UI that is accessible and user-friendly.

**Backend API:**

- Build a REST API for handling authentication.
- Include endpoints for:
  - User signup (creation).
  - User login (authentication).
- Store user data securely, utilizing a database solution of your choice.
- Return meaningful feedback to users for successful operations or common errors.

**Security:**

- Implement security best practices, including password hashing and data validation.

**Testing:**

- Write relevant test cases for both the frontend and backend components to verify functionality and improve stability.

**Bonus Points (Optional):**

- Implement session management to keep users logged in.
- Add a "Forgot Password" flow for account recovery.
- Demonstrate any additional improvements or features that enhance the experience.

**Expectations:**

- We expect you to spend approximately 5-6 hours on this challenge.
- Document your assumptions, decisions, and any shortcuts you take.
- Ensure the solution is easy to run locally.
- You may use LLM models for assistance; however, after successful evaluation of your work, you will be questioned about your implementation to ensure you fully understand the solution.

**Submission:**

- Create a public GitHub repository with your solution.
- Include clear setup instructions in the README, covering how to run the app and tests, as well as a description of the architectural decisions you chose.

We value your effort and creativity in tackling this challenge. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us!
